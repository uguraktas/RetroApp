## Quick Start Guide

Let's get your CodeBaseHub instance running locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/codebasehub.git
cd codebasehub
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure your settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Update your `.env.local` file with your database URL and other configuration:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 4. Initialize the Database

Run the database migrations to set up your schema:

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Features Overview

### Authentication System

CodeBaseHub uses [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com) for authentication, providing:

- Email/password authentication
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Two-factor authentication
- Session management
- Role-based access control

### AI Integration

The built-in AI chat system includes:

- Streaming responses
- Context awareness
- Modern chat UI
- Easy provider switching

### Database & API

The platform includes:

- **Prisma ORM** for type-safe database access
- **tRPC** for end-to-end type safety
- **PostgreSQL** ready (works with other databases too)
- **API routes** with proper error handling

## Customization Guide

### Branding & Theme

1. **Update Colors**: Modify `tailwind.config.ts` to match your brand
2. **Logo & Assets**: Replace assets in the `public` folder
3. **Typography**: Customize fonts in `layout.tsx`

### Adding New Pages

Create new pages in the `src/app` directory:

```tsx
// src/app/my-page/page.tsx
export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-16">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">My New Page</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Database Schema

Update your database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
model Post {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

Then run migrations:

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository in Vercel
3. Set your environment variables
4. Deploy!

### Docker

```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Best Practices
